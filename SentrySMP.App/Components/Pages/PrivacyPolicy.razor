                    for shards, ranks, keys, battle pass, Eternal rank, or VIP

                    <strong>Minecraft Username</strong>: We collect and store
                    your Minecraft username to deliver purchased items to the
                    correct player account in the game and manage VIP
                    permissions through our server's permission system.

            <h2>How we use the data:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To analyze traffic and improve website functionality.</li>
                <li>
                    To ensure proper operation of the shopping cart and remember
                    your preferences.

                    keys) or benefits (VIP rank, Eternal rank, battle pass) to
                    your Minecraft account. For all purchases, we maintain a
                    record of your purchase date. Ranks have a one-month
                    expiration date.

                    ranks, keys, VIP rank, Eternal rank, battle pass) and apply
                    the appropriate benefits to your account. Ranks require
